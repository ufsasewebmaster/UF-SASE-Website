              Advisors can vary depending on your college/major. It’s recommended you meet with your advisor once a semester. This is required if you
              are in the College of Engineering. You can discuss your 4-year plan, how to possibly change your major, how drop/add works, or how to
              apply to take transient classes.

              As a baseline, you can start off by making your schedule similar to the model semester plan listed for your major (I.e. the Industrial

              Your college will offer different electives (technical, interdisciplinary, etc). These are usually listed on your respective college’s
              page. Also, if you have time, try to take classes outside of your major to gain perspective and develop interdisciplinary skills. Or
              just take a class for fun if you have the space for it.

            <>
              Now that you have a basic understanding of your requirements from 1.2, you can start filling out your 4-year plan. Your 4-year plan is a
              document that lists out 8 semesters and the specific classes/credits you plan to take each semester. Don’t forget to keep track of
              required prereqs. Upperclassmen/mentors can help a lot, especially with professor recommendations and maintaining a balanced schedule.
              <br /> <br />
              Note that it is normal if your 4-year plan deviates a little from the model semester plan or changes a lot as you progress.

              A few weeks out from registration, your registration date will be available on ONE.UF. Usually, upperclassmen get priority and get an
              earlier date.
              <br /> <br />
              On the date and time listed, your registration will open up. Beforehand be prepared with what classes you want to take. Reference your
              major requirements and 4-year plan for this. You can create a mock schedule using{" "}

              to work out the timings of your classes. Also, it's very important to include backups as some classes fill up fast.
              <br /> <br />
              If possible reach out to an upperclassman (or someone who has an earlier date than you) because they are able to access how many seats
              are left for a specific class/section starting from their registration date.
              <br /> <br />
              On the day of, log in at your given time (usually 9 AM or 2 PM) and select your classes relatively quickly. If you don’t get a class you
              need, don’t stress out yet. More seats may open later on (so keep checking). Also, schedules change a lot during add/drop week, so
              getting a seat then is another possibility. Sometimes, it doesn’t hurt to email an advisor/professor.

              Actually, go to Office Hours! Going to your professor/TA’s office hours can save you a lot of time on your assignments. Also, professors
              sometimes share unique information about the class/exam during office hours. It’s a great chance to get to know your professor which is
              helpful for rec letters or other professional development opportunities.

              Transient credit is a great way to knock out some gen-ed requirements over the summer at your local Community College/ Florida
              university. Classes like Calc 2 or Physics 2 are commonly taken at CCs like Sante Fe/ Broward College, or Florida universities in your
              hometown (i.e. UNF in Jacksonville).
              <br /> <br />
              The transient credit does not count toward your overall UF GPA but does count toward your critical tracking GPA. Bright Futures also
              applies to these classes.
              <br /> <br />
              Get started at this{" "}

              </a>
              . After filling out the application, inform your advisor for their approval. After a couple more approvals, you will receive a login
              link from the other state college/university to register for classes.
              <br /> <br />
              Note, start this process relatively early in the Spring semester as seats do fill up for popular classes like Physics 2. Don’t forget to
              also send your transcript back to UF once the course is finished. Account for the time needed to send/process transcripts especially
              when taking prerequisite classes.

          question: "2.2 - Should I attend a career fair and/or professional conferences? How should I prepare?",
          answer: (
            <>
              Yes! Attending conferences early on will only boost your confidence in talking to recruiters about your professional goals. It’s really
              important to do your research prior to the conference. For companies you are interested in, learn about their mission statement, open
              positions, and how they create value in their space.
              <br /> <br />
              You can really impress a company by asking thoughtful questions. Even if a company isn’t looking for freshmen, it’s still a great chance
              to talk about what skills they recommend you focus on or the attributes of a stand-out applicant.
              <br /> <br />
              There are many more conferences than the Fall/Spring Career Fairs. Some others include:

              From the researcher’s perspective, they don’t have to pay you because you’re an undergrad (although some labs might provide a stipend).
              Also, sometimes they might prefer an underclassman because they train you once early on and you can continue working at the lab for
              longer than an upperclassman.
              <br /> <br />
              The number 1 tip is to be persistent when reaching out to professors. Sometimes, you just get ghosted.

              professional relationships, and potentially get referrals. People are generally excited to help those just starting their careers, so
              the hardest step is usually taking the initiative to set up the call. LinkedIn is a great place to get started!

              SASE offers multiple opportunities to get more involved throughout the year.
              <br /> <br />
              Early in the fall, SASE intern applications will open. Through SASE interns you can gain a behind-the-scenes look into how an org like
              SASE operates by being on a committee to organize your own event. This is a great chance to work with others on a team, build leadership
              skills, and meet other SASE members. Contact our MICs on Discord, @justind1 and @bananna4756, to learn more!
              <br /> <br />
              Joining SASE intramurals is a great way to stay active and connect with new people as well. The sports offered include ultimate frisbee,
              indoor soccer, volleyball, rock league, flag football, and kickball. Contact our Sports Coordinators on Discord, @.brea.d and
              @thebluesummon, to learn more!
              <br /> <br />
              Also, at the start of the fall/spring semester, you can join the mentor-mentee program. Mentors can help guide you academically,
              professionally, and just be a friend. We encourage you to get to know your fellow mentees and mentor by participating in Mentorship Cup
              challenges.
              <br /> <br />
              Put your engineering skills to the test by joining SASE’s design team SET. Last spring, during SET's beta semester, our team created SET
              Bro, a fully functional robot with the ability to converse with SASE members. This year, we are looking to expand SET much more. Don't
              be afraid to apply if you think you lack experience. Contact our Technical Chairs on Discord, @kevintf2 and @mannvika, to learn more!
              <br /> <br />
              You can sign up to help out with the winter/spring banquet committee if you’re looking for a shorter-term commitment. The different
              committees you can apply for include programming, logistics, marketing, and decorations.
              <br /> <br />
              Also, being active in Discord, going to Nye in Marston, and attending SASE events (GBMS, workshops, socials, and service events) are
              always great ways to get involved.

              In general, keep an open mind. Try to explore any clubs that possibly pique your interest! Professional clubs outside of your major are
              a great way to gain perspective too. There are also unique clubs you can join. Some examples include the Ukulele club, Gator salsa,
              Gator Humans vs. Zombies, and the Archery club.
              <br /> <br />

              In general, the sooner the better! It’s important to start doing research, touring apartments, and signing your lease ideally by
              November or December. You can also check reviews and talk to people who are currently living in that complex.
              <br /> <br />
              Keep in mind that the longer you wait (especially after the new year), rental rates will increase and spots become more limited.
