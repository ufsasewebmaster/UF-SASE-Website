          This development is centered on <strong>five core values</strong> of our mission statement:{" "}
          <strong>leadership, professionalism, service, academics,</strong> and <strong>diversity.</strong> Our meetings and events are catered to
          ensure that not only our mission is being fulfilled, but also that a community of support among Asian heritage students is being built. We
          pride ourselves on our measurable successes but could not have done so without the help of our members, faculty, and sponsors.
