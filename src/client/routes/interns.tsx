                <strong>SASE Interns</strong> collaborate with other members to
                execute a project for the SASE community, honing your
                communication, event planning, and leadership skills. Throughout
                the process, interns will gain{" "}
                <strong>experience to add to your resume</strong> and talk about
                during job interviews. Interns will also obtain{" "}
                <strong>behind-the-scenes insights</strong> through board
                presentations and shadowing opportunitiesâ€”valuable for future
                leadership roles in and out of SASE. Aside from projects,
                interns will have the chance to network and connect through{" "}
                <strong>interns-only</strong> socials and Board x Interns
                events.
