    <p className="mb-4 text-black">
      Since being founded during the summer of 2010, the University of Florida
      chapter has had an abundant effort put forth for the development of our
      members.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4 text-black">
      This development is centered on five core values of our mission statement:
      leadership, professionalism, service, academics, and diversity. Our
      meetings and events are catered to ensure that not only our mission is
      being fulfilled, but also that a community of support among Asian heritage
      students is being built. We pride ourselves on our measurable successes
      but could not have done so without the help of our members, faculty, and
      sponsors.
