          Since being founded during the summer of 2010,
        </span>{" "}
        the University of Florida chapter has had an abundant effort put forth
        for the development of our members.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-800">
        This development is centered on{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">five core values</span> of our mission
        statement:{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          leadership, professionalism, service, academics,
        </span>{" "}
        and <span className="font-semibold">diversity.</span> Our meetings and
        events are catered to ensure that not only our mission is being
        fulfilled, but also that a community of support among Asian heritage
        students is being built. We pride ourselves on our measurable successes
        but could not have done so without the help of our members, faculty, and
        sponsors.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-800">
        Through <span className="font-semibold">events</span> we have hosted in
        the past, such as our annual Quick Race or the Southeast Regional
        Conferences of 2014-2016, many of our members have been able to get
        involved in committees and take on leadership roles. Many of our other
        events allow students to{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">develop professional skills</span> that
        are essential for positions in industry.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-800">
        Our SASE chapter is not only active on campus, but also within the{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Gainesville community</span>, such as
        when we participated in a 5K raising money for a local robotics team. We
        are also heavily involved in the{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Asian American Student Union</span> at
        the University of Florida, taking part in their annual welcome assembly
        and hosting events with cultural and professional sub-organizations.
