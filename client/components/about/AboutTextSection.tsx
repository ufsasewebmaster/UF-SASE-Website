      The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) at UF was established
      in 2010 as a student organization dedicated to the advancement of Asian
      heritage scientists and engineers. Above all, SASE is a welcoming
      community of driven individuals who celebrate culture and diversity,
      cultivating a unique balance between professional development and a
      supportive, fun community.

      Through our general body meetings, socials, workshops, and internal
      mentorship program, we aim to build our members’ relationships, skills,
      and knowledge that will enable them to succeed. We also offer an
      intramural program (SASE Sports), an engineering team (SET), and a
      leadership development program (SASE Interns). UF SASE continues to
      provide more development opportunities to our members year after year, all
      while staying as welcoming as ever! Even if you’re not a STEM major, or of
      Asian heritage, SASE welcomes you with open arms.
