                  The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) at UF was established in 2010 as a student organization dedicated to the advancement of Asian heritage scientists and engineers.
                  Above all, SASE is a welcoming community of driven individuals who celebrate culture and diversity, cultivating a unique balance between professional development and a supportive, fun community.
                  Through our general body meetings, socials, workshops, and internal mentorship program, we aim to build our members’ relationships, skills, and knowledge that will enable them to succeed.
                  We also offer an intramural program (SASE Sports), an engineering team (SET), and a leadership development program (SASE Interns).
                  UF SASE continues to provide more development opportunities to our members year after year, all while staying as welcoming as ever! Even if you’re not a STEM major, or of Asian heritage, SASE welcomes you with open arms.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Since being founded during the summer of 2010, the University of Florida chapter has had an abundant effort put forth for the development of our members.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              This development is centered on five core values of our mission statement: leadership, professionalism, service, academics, and diversity. Our meetings and events are catered to ensure that not only our mission is being fulfilled, but also that a community of support among Asian heritage students is being built. We pride ourselves on our measurable successes but could not have done so without the help of our members, faculty, and sponsors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Through events we have hosted in the past, such as our annual Quick Race or the Southeast Regional Conferences of 2014-2016, many of our members have been able to get involved in committees and take on leadership roles. Many of our other events allow students to develop professional skills that are essential for positions in industry, such as Mock Interviews with representatives from General Electric, or networking skills to grow lasting connections and relations, such as Lunch with Recruiters sponsored by Procter & Gamble, and informational sessions with Accenture, Medtronic, Dow Chemical, and Harris Corporations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Our SASE chapter is not only active on campus, but also within the Gainesville community. We have participated in a 5K raising money for a local robotics team and made dinner for the families at the Ronald McDonald House. We are also heavily involved in the Asian American Student Union at the University of Florida, taking part in their annual welcome assembly, hosting events with cultural and professional sub-organizations, and participating in discussions of current events and issues within the Asian-American community and beyond.
